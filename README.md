# Social network of scientific collaborations evolution model

## Introduction
The co-authorship network of scientists represents a prototype of complex evolving networks.
I propose a simple model that captures the networkâ€™s time evolution and a numerical simulation to uncover the behavior of
quantities that could not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical results
underline the important role internal links play in determining the observed scaling behavior and
network topology. The results and methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship
network could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving networks as well,
such as the world wide web, Internet, or other social networks.

We denote by ***k<sub>i</sub>(t)*** the number of links node ***i*** has at time ***t***; by ***T(t)*** and ***N(t)*** the
total number of links and total number of nodes at time ***t***, respectively.
